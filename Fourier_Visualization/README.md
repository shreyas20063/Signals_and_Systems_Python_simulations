# Fourier Series Visualization

Interactive Fourier series exploration tool created for the Signals and Systems course (EE204T) under Prof. Ameer Mulla by Duggimpudi Shreyas Reddy and Prathamesh Nerpagar.

## Project Structure

- `core/` — waveform definitions and Fourier series helpers  
- `gui/` — Matplotlib-based UI for the visualization  
- `main.py` — entry point used to launch the app

## Getting Started

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Move the slider to select the number of harmonics and switch between square and triangle waves to compare their Fourier series behaviour.
