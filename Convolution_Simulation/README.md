## Introduction

The Convolution Simulator is a comprehensive educational tool designed to help students and engineers understand convolution operations through interactive visualization. The application supports both continuous-time and discrete-time signals, offering mathematical and block-step visualization modes to illustrate the convolution process step by step.

Convolution is a fundamental operation in signal processing, defined mathematically as:

**Continuous-time:** $y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau)h(t-\tau)d\tau$

**Discrete-time:** $y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k]h[n-k]$

   - Shows filtering effects

## Custom Mode

Custom Mode allows you to define your own signals using mathematical expressions. The simulator supports a wide range of mathematical functions and signal processing operations.

## Signal Syntax Guide

### Continuous-Time Signals (Variable: t)

For continuous signals, use standard mathematical expressions with `t` as the independent variable.

#### Basic Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `*` | Multiplication | `2 * u(t)` |
| `+`, `-` | Addition, Subtraction | `rect(t+1) - rect(t-1)` |
| `**` or `^` | Exponentiation/Power | `t**2` or `t^2` |
| `/` | Division | `rect(t/2)` |

#### Special Functions

**u(...)** - Unit Step Function
- Represents the Heaviside step function (0 for negative inputs, 1 for positive inputs)
- Examples:
  - `u(t)` → Step that turns on at t=0
  - `u(t-2)` → Step that turns on at t=2
  - `u(t) - u(t-5)` → Rectangular pulse of width 5

**rect(...)** - Rectangular Pulse
- Rectangular pulse of height 1, centered at 0, with total width of 1 (from -0.5 to 0.5)
- Examples:
  - `rect(t)` → Standard rectangular pulse
  - `rect(t-3)` → Pulse centered at t=3
  - `rect(t/2)` → Pulse with width doubled to 2

**tri(...)** - Triangular Pulse
- Triangular pulse of height 1, centered at 0, with base width of 2 (from -1 to 1)
- Examples:
  - `tri(t)` → Standard triangular pulse
  - `5 * tri(t)` → Triangle with peak height of 5

#### Standard Functions
- `exp(...)` - Exponential function (e^x)
- `sin(...)` - Sine function
- `cos(...)` - Cosine function

#### Example Expressions
```
exp(-2*t) * u(t)
sin(2*3.14*t) * (u(t) - u(t-1))
rect(t) * cos(5*t)
```

### Discrete-Time Signals (Variable: n)

Discrete signals can be defined in two ways: as a function of the index n or as a direct list of values.

#### 1. As a Function of n
The syntax is nearly identical to the continuous-time case, but uses `n` as the variable.

**Keywords:**
- `u(n)`, `rect(n)`, `tri(n)` work as expected for discrete indices
- `delta[n]` or `δ[n]` - Unit impulse at n=0 (discrete signals only)

**Examples:**
```
0.9**n * u(n)
cos(0.5*n) * u(n)
5*delta[n] + 2*delta[n-1]
```

#### 2. As a Python List
Define sequences by directly typing values. The first element corresponds to n=0.

**Format:** `[value1, value2, value3, ...]`

**Examples:**
```
[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]        # Sequence with value 1 at n=0, 2 at n=1, etc.
[1, -1]                # Simple differentiator system
[1, 1, 1, 1]          # Four-point moving average filter
```

## Continuous vs Discrete Simulation

### Continuous-Time Mode
- Uses numerical integration for convolution computation
- Adjustable sampling rate (50-2000 Hz) for accuracy vs. performance
- Smooth animation with configurable time steps
- Mathematical visualization shows integral interpretation
- Supports arbitrary mathematical functions

### Discrete-Time Mode
- Uses exact discrete convolution algorithms
- Integer index stepping for precise discrete behavior
- Stem plots for proper discrete signal representation
- Mathematical visualization shows summation interpretation
- Supports both functional and list-based signal definitions

## Visualization Modes

### Mathematical View
The default view shows four synchronized plots:
1. **Input Signal x(τ) or x[k]**: The original input signal
2. **Flipped & Shifted Impulse Response**: h(t-τ) or h[n-k] showing the time-reversed and shifted version
3. **Product**: Point-wise multiplication x(τ)h(t-τ) or x[k]h[n-k]
4. **Convolution Result**: Final output y(t) or y[n] with current time/index highlighted

### Block-Step View
An additional right panel showing the step-by-step convolution process:
1. **Flip**: Time-reverse the impulse response h(-τ) or h[-k]
2. **Shift**: Translate to current time h(t-τ) or h[n-k]
3. **Multiply**: Point-wise multiplication with input signal
4. **Integrate/Sum**: Final integration or summation step

## Export Options

### PNG Snapshots
- High-resolution (300 DPI) image export
- Captures current state of all plots
- Suitable for reports and presentations

### CSV Data Export
- Exports time/index and convolution result values
- Compatible with Excel, MATLAB, and other analysis tools
- Includes proper headers for data identification

### GIF Animations
- Creates animated sequences showing the entire convolution process
- Configurable frame rate and duration
- Perfect for educational materials and presentations

## Known Issues and Fixes

### Performance Considerations
- **Large Time Ranges**: Computation time increases with range size. Recommended maximum: 1000 time units
- **High Sampling Rates**: Rates above 2000 Hz may cause UI lag on slower systems
- **Complex Expressions**: Highly oscillatory functions may require increased sampling rates

### Common Expression Errors
1. **Unbalanced Parentheses**: Check that all `(` have matching `)`
2. **Invalid Function Names**: Use `exp()` not `exponential()`, `sin()` not `sine()`
3. **Variable Confusion**: Use `t` for continuous, `n` for discrete
4. **List Format**: Discrete lists must use square brackets `[1,2,3]`

### Animation Issues
- **Stuttering**: Reduce playback speed or sampling rate
- **Memory Usage**: Long animations may consume significant memory
- **GIF Export**: Large GIFs may take several minutes to generate
